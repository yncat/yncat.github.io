# iOS16.0.2でも治ってなかったので、ちょっとおこな感じで

英語だと、ちょっとおこな感じを出したかったら文章を雑にすればいいので楽ですね。日本語だとこれがまあ色々考えないといけなくて面倒くさいことこのうえない。

Hello. 

I'm reporting a bug introduced in iOS16 Voiceover. 

This bug is severely affecting Japanese users, and needs to be fixed as soon as possible. 

I've confirmed that this bug has not been fixed in iOS 16.0.2. 

Here are the details. 

Steps to reproduce: 

1. Make a text "¥100" (in UTF-8 JSON compliant form, "\xc2\xa5100"). 
2. Try to read the text with any of the voiceover Japanese voices. 

Expected(iOS 15): The text is read as "100 yen" 

Actual(iOS 16): The text is never read 

Basically, any text which includes Japanese currency Yen are not read properly, and it is critical for native Japanese users. Please, fix this issue ASAP!
